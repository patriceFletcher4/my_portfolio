          As her quote suggests, Patrice is the type of positive and encouraging person that make her ideal for engaging with event guests and problem solving on the W&Co. team. Her active role in family-life and her daughter's dance troupe keep her very busy and she likes to get outdoors to enjoy a nice relaxing walk when it's time to let off steam.

          After 15 years in retail management Patrice decided to make a career change that would utilize her excellent customer service, and organization skills in a whole new way. And so she hit the books, and graduated from the University of Florida with a speculation in Event Management! She's always willing to offer a helping hand, and take-on the heavy lifting. We sometimes need to remind her to take a break!
